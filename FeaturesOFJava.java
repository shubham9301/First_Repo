        System.out.println("\n\n(1). Platform Independent :- ");
        System.out.println("\tJava is platform independent because it is compiled into bytecode, an intermediate code that runs \n\ton any operating system with a java virtual machine (JVM) installed. This architecture allows a program \n\tto be compiled once and then run on any system, embodying the '' WORA - Write Once, \n\tRun Anywhere '' principle . ");

        System.out.println("\n(2). Object-Oriented :- ");
        System.out.println("\tjava is a purely object oriented language that uses classes and objects to structure programs, \n\tincorporating concepts like   ~ ~ Inheritance , Polymorphism , Encapsulation , and Abstraction.");

        System.out.println("\n(3). Simple :- ");
        System.out.println("\tjava's syntax is clean and inspired by c / c++, making it easier to learn and use, \n\tespecially for those with experience in those languages.");

        System.out.println("\n(4). Secured and Robust :- ");
        System.out.println("\tJava is a reliable programming language because it can catch mistajes early while writing the \n\tcode and also keeps checking for errors when the program is running. It also has a feature called \n\t''exception handling'' that helps deal with unexpected problems smoothly.");

        System.out.println("\n(5). Portable :- ");
        System.out.println("\tWhen we write a java program, the code first converted into bytecode and this bytecode \n\tdoes not depend on any operating system or any specific computer. We can simply execute \n\tthis bytecode on any platform with the help of JVM. Since JVMs are available on \n\tmost devices and thats why we can run the same java program on different platforms.");

        System.out.println("\n(6). Free :- ");
        System.out.println("\tJava is a free to use programming language - the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is necessary \n\tfor development, is free to download and use.");

        System.out.println("\n");
